## üöÄ Demonstration Tools Created

### Core Files
1. **`simple_example.yaml`** - Minimal working example
2. **`service_company.yaml`** - Complex business website
3. **`restaurant_example.yaml`** - Industry-specific example
4. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
5. **`demo_examples.php`** - Analysis and demonstration script
6. **`process_example.sh`** - Convenience processing script

### Generated Outputs
- **Analysis Reports:** Each example generates detailed analysis showing sections, features, and configuration overview
- **Demo Files:** Sample files showing what the processor would generate
- **Processing Instructions:** Clear commands for how to use each example

## üé® Key Concepts Demonstrated

### YAML Structure Flexibility
```yaml
# Same structure, different content
sections:
  - type: "hero"           # Works for all website types
  - type: "services"       # Becomes "menu" for restaurants
  - type: "contact"        # Adapts to business needs
```

### Industry Adaptation
- **Tech Company:** Blue colors, service cards, team profiles
- **Restaurant:** Red/gold colors, menu categories, reservations
- **Simple Site:** Clean colors, basic sections, minimal features

### Progressive Complexity
- **Simple:** 3 sections, basic features
- **Service:** 8 sections, advanced features
- **Restaurant:** 8 sections, industry-specific features
