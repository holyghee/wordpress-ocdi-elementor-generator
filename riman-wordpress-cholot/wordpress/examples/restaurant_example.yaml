    subtitle: "Three generations of Italian culinary tradition"
    content: |
      Bella Vista Ristorante opened its doors in 1952, when Nonna Giulia
      brought her cherished family recipes from Tuscany to share with our
      local community. Today, her grandson Marco continues the tradition,
      using only the finest imported ingredients and time-honored techniques.
      
      Every dish tells a story of our heritage, crafted with passion and
      served with the warmth of Italian hospitality.
