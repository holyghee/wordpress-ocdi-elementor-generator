# Execute the research swarm with full context
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "CONTEXT: We have a working WordPress XML generator (generate_wordpress_xml.py) that converts YAML to WordPress/Elementor sites. We have 7 real Elementor JSON templates from Cholot theme with 13 custom widgets. We've built adaptive layout engine, content-design separator, and block library system. HTML/CSS conversion proved too complex. Core challenge: Generate valid Elementor JSON (400+ parameters per widget) from simple user input (business name, 3-10 services). 

RESEARCH FOCUS: Test if LLMs can reliably generate valid Elementor JSON when given our complete templates as examples, widget documentation, and validation rules. Compare with fixed code patterns and hybrid approaches. Build on our existing working code, don't reinvent.

KEY FILES TO ANALYZE: generate_wordpress_xml.py (working), elementor-templates/*.json (real data), adaptive-layout-engine.py (layout logic), content-design-separator.py (core concept), block-library-system.py (template extraction).

DELIVERABLE: Definitive recommendation with working prototype - LLM vs Fixed Code vs Hybrid for production business website generator." \
