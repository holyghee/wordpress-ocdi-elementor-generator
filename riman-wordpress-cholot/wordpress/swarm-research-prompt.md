# Research Swarm Prompt: Elementor JSON Generation

## Command to run:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Research optimal approach for generating complex Elementor JSON from simple user input: LLM vs Fixed Code vs Hybrid solutions" \
  --strategy research \
  --neural-patterns enabled \
  --memory-compression high \
  --agents 4 \
  --topology hierarchical
```

## Research Context and Constraints:

**Problem Definition:**
Generate valid Elementor WordPress page builder JSON (400+ parameters per widget) from minimal user input (business type, services, preferences) for the Cholot retirement community theme.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must generate valid Elementor JSON that imports without errors
- Cholot theme has 13 custom widgets (cholot-hero, cholot-texticon, cholot-services, etc.)
- Each widget has 20-50+ configuration parameters
- JSON structure is deeply nested and highly specific
- Target users: Non-technical business owners

**Current Evidence:**
- Fixed code approach works but is limited to predefined patterns
- Direct LLM generation often produces invalid JSON structures
- HTML/CSS conversion is extremely complex due to Elementor's unique structure
- Template-based approach with variable substitution shows promise
- User needs flexibility for content variation (3 services vs 6 services)

## Research Questions to Answer:

1. **LLM Capability Assessment:**
   - Can current LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) reliably generate valid Elementor JSON?
   - What context length and examples are needed for consistent results?
   - How do fine-tuned models compare to general models?
   - What are the failure rates and error patterns?

2. **Fixed Code vs LLM Trade-offs:**
   - Performance comparison (speed, accuracy, maintenance)
   - Flexibility vs reliability analysis
   - Cost considerations (API calls vs development time)
   - Scalability for adding new layouts/widgets

3. **Hybrid Architecture Options:**
   - Content generation by LLM + Structure by fixed code
   - LLM for layout decisions + Templates for implementation
   - Multi-stage refinement approaches
   - Validation and error correction systems

4. **Alternative Technical Approaches:**
   - WordPress/Elementor API integration possibilities
   - Block library systems with content injection
   - Schema-guided generation techniques
   - Template parameterization vs full generation

## Deliverables Requested:

1. **Comprehensive Technical Analysis:**
   - Benchmark all approaches with real Elementor JSON examples
   - Quantify success rates, performance metrics
   - Identify optimal use cases for each approach

2. **Implementation Roadmap:**
   - Recommended architecture with justification
   - Development phases and milestones
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Resource requirements

3. **Proof of Concept:**
   - Working prototype of recommended approach
   - Test cases with various complexity levels
   - Error handling and validation mechanisms

4. **Decision Framework:**
   - When to use which approach
   - Scaling considerations
   - Maintenance and evolution path

## Research Methodology:

- **Literature Review:** Analyze existing solutions for complex JSON generation
- **Empirical Testing:** Test LLMs with actual Elementor JSON samples
- **Comparative Analysis:** Benchmark all approaches systematically
- **Prototype Development:** Build minimal viable implementations
- **Expert Validation:** Review findings with WordPress/Elementor specialists

## Success Criteria:

- Generate valid Elementor JSON with >95% success rate
- Support variable content (1-10 services, different layouts)
- Process time <30 seconds per page
- Maintainable codebase that can evolve with Elementor updates
- Cost-effective for small business use cases
